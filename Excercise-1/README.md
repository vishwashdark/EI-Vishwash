Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design patterns
Come up creatively with six different use cases to demonstrate your understanding of the following software design patterns by coding the
same.

1. Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern.
2. Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern.
3. Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern.

Behavioural Design Patterns:

1. Observer
    Made a class that observes another class.
    Phones class observer the weather class for updates.

2. Template Method
    Making a class that inherits another class and defines a template method that is called by the subclass.
    Done using the Example of Making Juices

Creational Design Patterns:

1. Factory
    Making a class that creates another class.
    Done using example of Fruit Baskets

2. Builder Design Pattern
    Making a class that builds another class.
    Done using a example of making a Car

Structural Design Patterns:

1. Adapter

    Making a class that adapts another class.
    Done using example of car tires

2. Composite

    Making a class that composites another class.
    Done using example of making a car parts
